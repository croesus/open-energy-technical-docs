    Metadata
        Data that gives information about what is contained in the dataset.
        OE advocates that metadata should be open, except for extremely sensitive cases (e.g. matters of national security). Metadata is a contested term, with different organisations in the sector currently using different standards. Open Energy is designed to support a range of metadata formats - it is beyond the scope of the project to standardise metadata requirements in the sector.

        Big contrast to traditional grid operation built around linear electricity flows.

    Peer-to-peer (P2P) trading
        Energy trading directly between users/consumers, removing the 'middle man'.
        Not currently permitted in the UK due to regulatory arrangements regarding the 'supplier hub model' and single supplier.
