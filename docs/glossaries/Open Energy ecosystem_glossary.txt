    Data sensitivity class
        OE members can self-allocate dataset into ‘classes’ depending on its sensitivity profile. Access and security requirements differ across classes.
        Consultation on data classes is currently open until 30 April 2021: `docs.google.com: edit <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9Aj7uW5DEkhZjdBw5JI6t7qi_ojMIeKrBxyDWhD2n8/edit>`_
